# Project Overview

The Next.js project is a powerful framework for building server-rendered React applications. It combines the benefits of React with server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and an intuitive routing system.

The Faculty Feedback System is a web-based application built with Next.js, designed to streamline and automate the process of collecting feedback from students regarding their experience with faculty members. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to submit their feedback anonymously and confidentially, and offers faculty members valuable insights into their teaching performance and areas for improvement.
